Comparisons of Ground Motion Predictions for EEW

This code package is written to compare ground motion predictions made from different algorithms. The original intent is to compare the source models coming out of geodetic algorithms for ShakeAlert, the different seismic algorithms, and the ground truth (real PGA/PGV values recorded at seismic stations).
